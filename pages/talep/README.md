# Talep Pages

This directory contains the request detail pages for the Fırat University Authentication System.

## Important Notes

- The primary implementation is in `[id].tsx`, which includes TypeScript support, comments functionality, and role-based features.
- The `[id].js` file has been modified to redirect to the TypeScript implementation but is kept for reference.
- In a future update, consider removing the `.js` version completely to avoid duplicate page warnings.

## Features in the TypeScript Version

- Complete comment system
- Status update functionality for admin/academic users
- Role-based access control
- Modern UI with Fırat University styling
- Enhanced error handling and loading states
